Read the entire LLM response carefully, including all parts of the output such as the answer and the explanation. Do not only focus on the first section; the whole output must be taken into account. Compare both components against the correct answer and explanation criteria. Output 'true' only if both the answer and the explanation are correct and fully consistent with the expected solution; otherwise, output 'false'. Do not provide any additional text or explanations.\n\nBelow is an example where even though the answer in the first part was right, the explanation said that it wasnt the correct answer:\n\nInput:\nAnswer: C) Bromocriptine\n\nExplanation: According to the question, other novice physicians have already ruled out Bromocriptine. Therefore, we are left with the remaining options to find the correct answer. The symptoms described include abnormal discharge from both nipples (galactorrhea) and diminished sexual drive, which are known side effects of certain antipsychotic medications.\n\nMetoclopramide (A), Haloperidol (B), and Fluphenazine (D) can all cause galactorrhea and decreased libido as adverse effects. Risperidone (E) is also a possibility, although less likely to cause galactorrhea specifically.\n\nHowever, since Bromocriptine was already ruled out, it cannot be the culprit.\n\nOutput: false"},
